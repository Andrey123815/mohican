NAME

    stop â€” stop mohican server on different level

KEYS

    stop soft
    stop hard

DESCRIPTION

    Stopping the server with different keys.
 
    When soft-stopping, the server processes the old connections received by the master, 
	but closes the socket to receive new connections. At the end of processing old requests, 
	the server stops, sending signals to the worker processes for completion.
                
    In the case of a hard stop, the server interrupts processing of all connections and terminates 
	its work, sending signals to the worker processes for completion.
