RELOAD(1)                                         Mohican General Commands Manual                                        RELOAD(1)

NAME

    reload â€” reload mohican server on different level

KEYS

    reload soft
    reload hard

DESCRIPTION

    The server reload with the hard and stop keys.     

    Reloading with the soft level implies the creation of a new master process, 
	bind socket, and the creation of worker processes by this process. Then the new master 
	process sends a soft stop signal to the old master process, by which it blocks the socket 
	to accept new connections, terminates the old connections. After that, it shuts down 
	the worker processes and exits itself with the status displayed in the log with the INFO level.          

    Reloading with the hard level implies a similar algorithm, with sending a hard stop signal 
	to the old master process. When this signal is received, the old master process breaks 
	all current connections, shuts down the worker processes, and then exits with 
	the status displayed in the log with the INFO level.
