NAME

    start â€” starting Mohican server

DESCRIPTION

    Starting the server involves clearing the logs, clearing 
	the pid file created to display the processes involved in the 
	operation of the server. The server master process is being 
	daemonized to ensure that the process is independent of bash or other 
	environments. Bind socket is performed, adding new workers that inherit 
	this handle to get connections. Worker processes produce accept new connections.
